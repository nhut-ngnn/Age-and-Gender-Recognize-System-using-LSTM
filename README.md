## The Problem

Develop an application which facilitates:
- Gender recognition of a person based on a voice recording.
- Age group identification of a person based on a voice recording.

## The dataset
For this project we've used <p><a href="https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets" target="_blank"><strong>Download Mozilla Common Voice Dataset</strong></a></p>, namely, the English dataset for gender classification and age classification. And the English, French and German datasets for language classification. The gender dataset contains 230,000 samples, labeled as male, female or other. The age dataset contains 250,000 samples labeled from teens to eighties, in tens of years increments. The language dataset is self-explanatory.
